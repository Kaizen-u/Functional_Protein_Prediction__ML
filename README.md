# Functional_Protein_Prediction__ML
This study presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting protein function utilizing physicochemical features derived from a curated dataset of Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteins. Physicochemical parameters, including molecular weight, hydrophobicity, isoelectric point, and instability index, were employed as predictive features.
